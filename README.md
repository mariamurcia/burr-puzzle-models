# burr-puzzle-models
STL files for the blocks used in the burr puzzle assembly training research study

Note:
- An image with assembly instructions (instructions.png) for each of the puzzles has been included.
- The STL file name indicates the block code (A-I) and the colour assigned to the piece in the instructions.
- Blocks were 3D printed (block length = 12cm, block width = 3cm) using a Ultimaker 2+ 3D printer with a 0.4mm nozzle and standard settings, with PLA 3D printing material.
