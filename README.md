# burr-puzzle-models
STL files for the blocks used in the burr puzzle assembly training research study

Notes:
- An image with assembly instructions (instructions.png) for each of the puzzles has been included.
- The STL file name identifies the block and indicates the colour assigned to the piece in the instructions.
- Blocks were 3D printed (block length = 12cm, block width = 3cm) using a Ultimaker 2+ 3D printer with a 0.4mm nozzle and standard settings, with PLA 3D printing material.
- Burr Tools 0.6.3 software (http://burrtools.sourceforge.net/) was used
to digitally create and solve the three versions of the six-piece burr puzzles as well as to generate the paper instructions.
